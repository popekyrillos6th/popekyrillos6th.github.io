# Favorite cpsc 120 Labs
* Lab 6 part-2
  
  I think this lab was fun because a couple weeks before we did the lab my friend was telling me we should go to his house and play poker but I didn’t know how. So I learned how to play while doing this lab and it also taught me how to keep score while playing. 



* Lab 9 part-1
   
  I like lab 9 because I like how we coded it where I made the judges have an average. I also like how I made the judges calculate the average score and if the average score was low the player would be eliminated.



* Lab 11 Part-1
  
  I liked lab 11 because I think it’s really interesting that I was able to make the code to where it can tell me the price of the pizza by the amount of calories the pizza is.
